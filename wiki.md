# 🤖 REChain ® Autonomous Agent for Pythagorean Perpetual Futures — Wiki

Welcome to the wiki for the **Autonomous Agent for Pythagorean Perpetual Futures (pyth-)**, part of the REChain Network Solutions stack.

This smart agent autonomously trades and balances **perpetual derivatives** using a **Pythagorean-styled mathematical model**, which maintains risk equilibrium through geometric positioning of long/short and margin scaling.

---

## 📌 Purpose

The `pyth-` agent:

- Tracks perpetual markets (price, volatility, funding)
- Calculates geometrically optimal entry/exit
- Self-adjusts position sizing based on risk distribution
- Integrates with decentralized oracles (e.g. Katya-Oracle, Pyth, REChain-native)
- Deploys trades through smart contract interfaces or relayers

## 🧮 Pythagorean Engine

The core model works by assuming:

- Each side of the triangle (long, short, neutral) represents a risk exposure vector.
- The hypotenuse represents total position risk.
- The agent calculates exposure adjustments so that `long² + short² = total²`.

This creates a self-balancing leverage system for derivatives.
